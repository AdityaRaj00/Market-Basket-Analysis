This project demonstrates a classic **Market Basket Analysis** using Python to uncover purchasing patterns from a sample set of transactions.  
It utilizes the **Apriori algorithm** from the `mlxtend` library to identify frequent itemsets and derive association rules ‚Äî revealing which products are likely to be purchased together.


## üéØ Analysis Overview

The goal of Market Basket Analysis is to find **relationships between items**.  
This is the same technique used by retailers like **Amazon** and **grocery stores** for:

- Product recommendations (‚ÄúCustomers who bought this also bought‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Strategic product placement and bundling

This script performs the following steps:

1. **Data Transformation:**  
   Converts the raw list of transactions into a one-hot encoded DataFrame suitable for analysis.

2. **Frequent Itemset Mining:**  
   Applies the Apriori algorithm to find groups of items that appear together frequently (based on a `min_support` threshold).

3. **Association Rule Generation:**  
   Creates rules from the frequent itemsets that predict the likelihood of buying one product given another (based on a `min_confidence` threshold).

4. **Visualization:**  
   Generates a bar chart to show the most popular individual items in the dataset.

5. **Output:**  
   Saves the discovered association rules to a CSV file for further review.

## üìä Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Support** | Fraction of transactions that contain a specific itemset. | A support of 0.5 for `{Milk, Eggs}` means they appear together in 50% of transactions. |
| **Confidence** | Likelihood that a customer will buy item B given they bought item A. | A confidence of 0.8 for `{Milk} ‚Üí {Eggs}` means 80% of Milk buyers also bought Eggs. |
| **Lift** | Measures how much more likely item B is purchased when item A is purchased. Lift > 1 implies a positive relationship. | A lift of 1.5 means buying Milk makes Eggs 1.5√ó more likely to be bought. |

## üß† Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- Required Python Libraries:
  ```bash
        pip install pandas mlxtend matplotlib
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Ensure all required libraries are installed.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script:

        python analysis.py
## üìà Results
After execution, the script will:

Print the one-hot encoded data, frequent itemsets, and the generated association rules to the console.

Display a bar chart of the top 5 most frequent items.

Create a CSV file named:

        market_basket_rules.csv
containing the detailed association rules.
